![RR1](../../images/instruments/rr/rr1.jpg){:width="50%" .align-right} Prynth based device  targeted for live performance. It is providing Supercollider synth engine controlled by 15 potentiometers, 5 CV's and 7x7 patching matrix modeled after [RePatcher](http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/Repatcher).

Analog/Digital pins provided by Teensy 3.5 with Prynth's code slightly tuned to add patching stuff. All nicely packed into aircraft's blackbox enclosure.

Planned features:

- OSC data exchange between Prynth and other systems.
- Additional sequencing engine.
- Ability to store/recall presets/patch-points/pot values onto Teensy's SD card.
- Additional potentiometer causing mixing matrix transitions to happen smoothly.
