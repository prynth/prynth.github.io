Last December we announced a PCB giveaway for people that were interested in building their own Prynth synthesizers. The only request was to show interest by sharing ideas and enthusiasm. We are now pleased to announce the winners:

. Thomas Herrmann (DE)

. Axel HÃ©lie-Fontaine (CA)

. Bruno Wiebelt (SE)

Congratulations and start those soldering irons! Hope to hear from you soon!
