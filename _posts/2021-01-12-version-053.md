Prynth has been updated to version 0.53. The functionality remains the same but we're now using the latest development tools. There was a problem with the Teensy code compilation due to changes in the Teensyduino API. This has now been fixed so you can use the latest Arduino 1.8.13 and Teensyduino 1.5.3. While at it, we've also updated to the latest RPi OS and SuperCollider 3.11.2. The SuperCollider plugins have also been included although they remain untested. The tests for this Prynth version were done on the Raspberry Pi 4 but the image should also work for the Raspberry Pi 3 B+.

As usual, let us know how it goes.
