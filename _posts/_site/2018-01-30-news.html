<p>It’s been a while since there was news from Prynth, but although quiet we’ve continued hard at work in our evil machinations.</p>

<p>In September last year we launched an experimental beta 0.4 distro, that incorporated just-in-time compiling capabilities, so that SuperCollider programs could executed on-the-fly. Since then we talked to several Prynth users and found key areas were we could make it better, thus deciding to take our time to make a new major revision in both hardware and software.</p>

<p>We are currently planning on a March release and the expected goodies include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Just-in-time compiling.</li>
  <li>Automatic execution of code blocks a la SuperCollider.</li>
  <li>Better management of Post window and errors.</li>
  <li>All new Muxi Control board, with I2C and SPI for digital devices.</li>
  <li>Full Serial RX/TX between SuperCollider and the Teensy.</li>
  <li>New sensor filtering implementation, based on the one euro filter by Casiez and team.</li>
  <li>Updated versions of Debian, SuperCollider and Node JS modules.</li>
  <li>Bug crushing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’d also like to take the opportunity to welcome Ajin Tom and Harish Venkatesan, who have joined the team to help in the development of this new release.</p>

<p>As always, if you have any suggestions, bug reports or instruments to show us, use the contacts on the webpage (prynth.github.io).</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
