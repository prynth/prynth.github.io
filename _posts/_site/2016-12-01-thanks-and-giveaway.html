<p>Thank you all for the amazing enthusiasm from makers and media. Maybe we are off to something really good!</p>

<p>To celebrate Prynth’s launch we are giving away 3 sets of PCB boards. To participate all you need to do is write a short description about the synth you want create and post or PM it through our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/prynth">Facebook page</a>. We’ll do a selection and mail the PCBs free of charge.</p>

<p>For those of you that have started experimenting, remember that for technical issues we’ll be using the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prynth">forum</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of people also asked if it was possible to buy the instruments pre-assembled. Unfortunately there are currently no plans for commercialization. Our goal is to facilitate DIY, share knowledge and together come up with some neat synth designs.</p>

<p>For those afraid of picking up the soldering iron, we say: don’t be intimidated! We’ve all been there. And once your first thingy works, be sure you’ll have that “yay” moment!</p>
