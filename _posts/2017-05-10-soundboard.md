Check out the SONIO soundboard, a Prynth-based collaborative music making device, developed by Tim Kong, Karen Cancino & Marc St. Pierre. Participants described the board as having a ‘futuristic’ feel, where the overall theme and for the sound and visuals was inspired by science fiction movies like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
