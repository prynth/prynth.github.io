# Prynth Electronics Boards

The Prynth electronics boards are distributed as [Eagle](https://cadsoft.io/) files.
After downloading the files use a service like [OshPark](https://oshpark.com/), [DirtyPCBs](http://dirtypcbs.com/) or any other manufacturer that accepts low quantity on-line ordering. Many of these accept Eagle board files directly, avoiding the complexity of handling multiple CAD files. Also check the documentation section on instructions for [board assembly](board-assembly.html).

# Raspberry Pi image

We have also created a Linux distribution for the Raspberry Pi, based on the official Raspbian Jessie Lite, but that automatically runs the Prynth software out-of-the-box.

Download the image file and head to the documentation for [installation details](install-rpi-image.html).
