![Close up](../images/framework_intro/soldering.jpg){: width="300px" .align-right} To get started creating your own synth you should read about the [Prynth framework](framework.html). After that you can explore the [documentation](/doc) and the [downloads](downloads.html) section for obtaining the necessary technical components.

This is a work-in-progress, so you might miss certain documentation or encounter various bugs. We ask you to file those through our [Github page](https://github.com/prynth/prynth) or the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prynth).
