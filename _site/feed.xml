Maybe we are off to something really good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate Prynth’s launch we are giving away 3 sets of PCB boards. To participate all you need to do is write a short description about the synth you want create and post or PM it through our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/prynth&quot;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll do a selection and mail the PCBs free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that have started experimenting, remember that for technical issues we’ll be using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prynth&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people also asked if it was possible to buy the instruments pre-assembled. Unfortunately there are currently no plans for commercialization. Our goal is to facilitate DIY, share knowledge and together come up with some neat synth designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those afraid of picking up the soldering iron, we say: don’t be intimidated! We’ve all been there. And once your first thingy works, be sure you’ll have that “yay” moment!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ivan Franco</name><email>ivan.almeida.franco@gmail.com</email><uri>https://ivanfranco.wordpress.com</uri></author><summary type="html">Thank you all for the amazing enthusiasm from makers and media.
