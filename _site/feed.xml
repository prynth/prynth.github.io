The first is at the Montreal Raspberry Pi users gathering, organized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://clubframboise.ca/&quot;&gt;Club Fambroise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://d3center.ca/en/home/&quot;&gt;District 3 Innovation Center&lt;/a&gt;.

Both events require signup with eventbrite.
It’s also a good time to remind that the application dates for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://artes.ucp.pt/enterface17/index.html&quot;&gt;Enterface 17&lt;/a&gt; workshop in Porto are closing soon.&lt;/p&gt;

I am pleased to announce a Prynth workshop as part of Enterface 17 (the 13th International Summer Workshop on Multimodal Interfaces), which will happen during the first two weeks of July in Porto (Portugal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are several other Prynth workshops in the planning, this one won’t be dedicated solely to DIY. We will definitely build our own synths but we plan on also creating a knowledge sharing group to discuss theories on interfaces between musician and performance device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mainly invite electronic musicians with electronics and programming chops but it would be great if there were any cognitive psychology gurus out there interested in tackling these questions and working with the group towards different perspectives and knowledge areas. Ideally by the end of the workshop we would have results leading to academic publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply for participation head over to:

&lt;p&gt;Applications open until April 21st.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ivan Franco</name><email>ivan.almeida.franco@gmail.com</email><uri>https://ivanfranco.wordpress.com</uri></author><summary>Looking forward to summertime building synths in sunny Portugal?

Maybe we are off to something really good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate Prynth’s launch we are giving away 3 sets of PCB boards. To participate all you need to do is write a short description about the synth you want create and post or PM it through our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/prynth&quot;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll do a selection and mail the PCBs free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that have started experimenting, remember that for technical issues we’ll be using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prynth&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people also asked if it was possible to buy the instruments pre-assembled. Unfortunately there are currently no plans for commercialization. Our goal is to facilitate DIY, share knowledge and together come up with some neat synth designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those afraid of picking up the soldering iron, we say: don’t be intimidated! We’ve all been there. And once your first thingy works, be sure you’ll have that “yay” moment!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ivan Franco</name><email>ivan.almeida.franco@gmail.com</email><uri>https://ivanfranco.wordpress.com</uri></author><summary>Thank you all for the amazing enthusiasm from makers and media.
